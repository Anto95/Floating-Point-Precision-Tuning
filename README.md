# Floating-Point-Precision-Tuning
Efficient floating point precision tuning for approximate computing.

This repository contains a re-implementation in C++ of the tool available at: https://github.com/minhhn2910/fpPrecisionTuning developed in python.

The method implemented has been designed by Nhut-Minh Ho, Elavarasi Manogaran, Weng-Fai Wong, Asha Anoosheh in "Efficient floating point precision tuning for approximate computing", ASP-DAC 2017 "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7858297/".

Please refer to the presentation "Efficient Floating Point Precision for Approximate Computing.pdf" for a simplified explaination of the method.
